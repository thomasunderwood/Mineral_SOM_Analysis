# Mineral_SOM_Analysis
Molecular Dynamics input files and analysis scripts to calculate clustering and partitioning of SOM on mineral surfaces.

Input files are to model SOM on the surfaces of montmorillonite and goethite.
Systems are entirely charge-balanced with either sodium ions or calcium ions.
